- The maximum length of filename is 255 characters, usually composed by letters, numbers, ".(dot)", "\_(underline)", "-".

- Filename can't include "/"; Because "/" means root directory or the separator in a path.

### Path
- Quote filename directly when the file is in current directory; And use file in other directory by specifying its directory.

- Absolute path is certain while relative path depends on working directory.

- Each directory has file "." means current location and file ".." means previous location.

Absolute path -- Start from root directory, for example: "/home/kylin/test"

Relative path -- Start from current directory, for example: (locate at /home) "kylin/test"

When locate at /etc, it can be expressed as "../home/kylin/test"
